# pfch_lomax
#I used python programming language to scrape the website and create a json file. Then cleaned up the json file and used the data to 
#geolocate each location for each entry using batch geocoder. Finally, using Tableu Public I was able to enter the latitude 
#and longitude of each entry and create map. It is far from perfect, but gives a good idea of the most popular locations for his 
#recordings. The file pfch-lomax.py shows the code that was used to scrape the data from the website. Recordings.json is the output of
#the scrape performed. Recordings-2.json shows the data cleaned up, after each entry had been put through the geocoder.
